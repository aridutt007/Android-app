# Activities - Android App

Project Goal #1

Develop an app for keeping track of current and recent user activities.

Required features:

  A simple app, allowing to enter, update, modify and delete activities, and to view them on screen. The app will show all activities for the user and their state (planning, active, etc), the last date/time it was worked on, and the last milestone - for example, if it's a book, last page stopped on, or any freestyle information the user wants to enter for the activity. 

Desired(nice to have) features (let's fill this out as well)
  Provide categories and tags for activities, and allow filtering on those
